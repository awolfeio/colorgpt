# colorgpt
A UI enhancement for ChatGPT. Color-code your conversations in a larger sidebar, filter by color, and even pin them to the top!

This extension helps greatly improve organization for ChatGPT power users, who may be juggling an array of conversations for a variety of topics that they would like to better organize. Not perfect at cleaning out all of your less important conversations? This helps! Mark the important ones with a color or pin to top!

NOTE: On initial load of the ChatGPT webpage, this extension automatically clicks the Show More button until all conversations have loaded. This is done to ensure your pinned conversations have entered the DOM to have their color and pinned settings load properly. Additionally:
1. This extension currently only supports screen sizes larger than ~1366px width.
2. It is best to rename a conversation to your preferred title before coloring or pinning. It is safe to rename after colored and pinned, but keep in mind that the color and pin will remove on rename, so you'll have to potentially hunt for the conversation to recolor and rename it.

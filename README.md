This extension greatly improves organization for ChatGPT power users, who may be juggling an array of conversations for a variety of topics that they would like to better organize. Not perfect at cleaning out all of your less important conversations? This helps! Mark them with a color or pin to top!

On initial load of the ChatGPT webpage, this extension automatically scrolls down the chat history sidebar several times. This is done to try and populate all of your pinned conversations. I am still working on optimizing this. If not all pinned messages are present, you may have to scroll down the chat history sidebar for them to populate.

Additionally:
1. This extension currently only supports screen sizes larger than ~1366px width.
2. It is best to rename a conversation to your preferred title before coloring or pinning. It is safe to rename after colored and pinned, but keep in mind that the color and pin will remove on rename, so you'll have to potentially hunt for the conversation to recolor and rename it.

Updated loading process and pin button CSS.
